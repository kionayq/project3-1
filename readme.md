### Overview

For the final project, you'll be designing and building a web app of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of JavaScript and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a web app that you can add to your portfolio. You could create anything from: a blog users can comment on; an app that allows users to search for social media posts; or even an application that logs users geolocations. Work with your instructor to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.
